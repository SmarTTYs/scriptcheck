  Direct handling

.test_2:
  # scriptcheck
  nested: |
    Nested with literal

  # scriptcheck
  list:
    - echo "element 1"
    - echo "element 2"

# todo: in cases where you mark the literal we are unable
#  to find the name as we currently do not traverse back
# todo: we could implement a name finder allowing to traverse back
#  which per default would just get a Mapping / MappingValue and then
#  at a later stage supports finding the parent of a literal

# scriptcheck
.test_3: &anchor: | # scriptcheck
     Literal with anchor

# scriptcheck
.test_4: > # scriptcheck
   Literal with anchor
